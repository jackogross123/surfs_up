# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
W.avy is interested in opening up an ice cream and surf shop on the island of Oahu. One of the biggest issues with opening the shop though was to determine if there was suitable weather year round for both surfing and ice cream. I was asked to analyze temperature and percipitation patterns to determine if the island of Oahu had suitable weather conditions to support an ice cream and surf shop year round. For the challenge, I was asked to create a query that would pull the temperatures from all of the weather stations for June and December. If the weather is promising in both the peak of the summer and the winter than theres a high chance that the surf ice cream shop would do very well!
